- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to display a limited number of hotels per page, ensuring a smooth browsing experience for users.

## Tech Stack

The Green Holiday Hotel Management System is built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store hotel and booking data.
- **Express**: A fast and flexible web application framework for Node.js, providing robust API endpoints for hotel and booking operations.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create a responsive and intuitive front-end for the hotel management system.
- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser, powering the back-end of the application.
